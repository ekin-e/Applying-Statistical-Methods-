# Applying-Statistical-Methods-

Apply the statistical methods we learned in class to identify differentially expressed genes with patients that have been diagnosed with 
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). We have separated GBM patients into two cohorts of short-(<= 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) survivors. This RNAseq data set was generated as a part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The detailed description of the dataset can be found under 
the following link (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structuralgenomics/tcga/studied-cancers/glioblastoma).

The raw data is publicly available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which will provide you with links to the raw data, but we have also preprocessed the data for you so you can instead just focus on the downstream analysis. We have used an R script to 
preprocess the data, but please feel free to implement your solution in any language you choose.
